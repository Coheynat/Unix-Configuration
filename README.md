# Unix Configuration Showcase

This project demonstrates Unix configuration and command-line skills with a simple data processing and report generation utility.

## Data

The input data is provided in the `data/input.csv` file. It contains columns `Name`, `Age`, and `Score`.

## Data Processing

To process the data and generate the report, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have `awk` and `grep` installed on your system.
2. Run the data processing script:

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ./data_processing.sh
